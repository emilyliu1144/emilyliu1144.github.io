                    Hello, my name is Emily and I am an undergraduate student from Boise State University studying
                    Games,
                    Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology.
                </p>
                <p>I specialize in Video Game Development and Front-End Web Development.</p>
                <p>I created this website to showcase all the projects I've worked on.</p>

                <h4>AR Photo Booth</h4>
                <h5>Solo Project</h5>
                <p>AR Photo Booth is a Windows PC app where you can take photos, and interact in a digital environment
                    with AR body tracking. You can set the chroma key by clicking on the camera feed for selecting a
                    specified color, and changing the slider values for the border and color feathering. Once it's set,
                    select an interactive environment and you're now ready to take some pictures! After pressing the
                    button, a 5-second countdown will start and the snapped photo shows up on the second monitor. If you
                    like the picture shown, you can save it and it will show up in the current folder of the app!</p>
                <p>This project is currently being made in Unity, and will be built for Windows PC.</p>

                <h4>Shrimp Mobile Data Narrative</h4>
                <h5>Solo Project</h5>
                <p>Shrimp Mobile Data Narrative is a website about the different types of shrimps discovered and where
                    you can find them. While there are over 2000 species of shrimps in the world, this website only show
                    shrimps that start from "A" to "C" from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System and SeaLifeBase
                    database search. The data visualizations shown in the website are Word Cloud, Radial Dendrogram, and
                    Density 2D Hexbin Chart. There is also a React Data Table near the end to show all the shrimps used.
                    Wikipedia was used to explain what shrimps are, and the different environments they appear in.</p>
                <p>This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Bootstrap to make the website
                    mobile-friendly, D3 to create the data visualizations, and React to make it run efficiently.</p>

                <h4>Target Practice</h4>
                <h5>Team Project</h5>
                <p>Target Practice is a 4-player, competitive multiplayer, FPS game played with LAN
                    connectivity. Players are tasked to score points by moving around in a sci-fi arena,
                    finding and shooting the randomly spawning targets, while also avoiding
                    axe-wielding enemies. All within a limited amount of time. When time is up, the player with the
                    highest score wins.</p>
                <p>This project was created with 3 other
                    students, and made in Unreal Engine 5. My contributions to the project were programming player
                    movement and shooting, LAN connectivity, and building the arena with free assets from the Fab store.

                <h5>Team Project</h5>
                <p>Dust Devil Dale is a 2-player, splitscreen co-op, side-scrolling beat 'em up game played with a
                    custom Arduino controller and gamepad. You play as Dust Devil Dale, a sheriff who got his gold
                    stolen by bandits. Fight off waves of enemies by punching and summoning lightning. Reach the end of
                    the level to reclaim your gold!</p>
                <p>This project was created with 3 other
                    students, and made in Unreal Engine 5. We worked with a client, who has cerebral palsy, to create an
                    accessible gaming controller made with Arduino for them to use. My contributions to the project were
                    programming the player movement, fighting system, spline-based camera movement, enemy AI and
                    spawning,
                    splitscreen multiplayer, retarget and fix Mixamo animations,
                    helping rig and import custom character models.</p>

                <h4>Galactic Pizza Party</h4>
                <h5>Solo Project</h5>
                <p>Galactic Pizza Party is singleplayer, open world VR game where you swing around the city like
                    Spider-Man. You play as a delivery boy working for the pizza chain Galactic Pizza Party LLC and your
                    job is to deliver pizzas to aliens. You're assigned to a planet with poor city planning that doesn't
                    support vehicle and bike transportation. The company's solution? Equip their delivery boys with
                    sticky gloves, wrist-mounted line launchers, and soft-landing boots! Drones would do a much better
                    job, but they're expensive to maintain and are prone to theft. So, equip your gear and start
                    delivering pizzas to those hungry customers!</p>
                <p>This was made in Unity, built for the Meta Quest 2. 3D models were made using Autodesk Maya, Adobe
                    Photoshop, and paint.NET.</p>

                <h5>Team Project</h5>
                <p>Abattoir is a singleplayer 2D side-scrolling game that uses a webcam, Victorian calling cards, and an
                    optional
                    Victorian trivia sheet to unlock doors in a dark castle. You play as a monster hunter looking for
                    the ultimate treasure, a mummy sarcophagus. You located it in a dark tomb filled with vampires and
                    werewolves. There are doors that are locked and the only way to open them is to scan the
                    coresponding card by holding it in front of your webcam. Navigate the maze, collect some treasure,
                    and claim the sarcophagus.</p>
                <p>This project was created with 4 other
                    students, and made in Unity with Vuforia for AR Image Tracking. My contributions to the project was
                    providing code for player movement and falling platforms,
                    creating the enemies, and testing the AR Image Tracking.</p>

                    top student of a prestigious fighting school suffering from burn out. She's about to start her daily
                    exercise, but was stopped by a group of sharks who wanted to fight. She quickly pummeled them and
                    went on with her day. Until it was revealed that they called for back up. After stealing her gym
                    bag, they escaped into an unfinished painting. With no other choice, she followed them.</p>
                <p>This project was my first introduction to Unity and game development. Characters and animated
                    cutscene were made using Adobe Animate. Other visual assets were made with

                    wondering if it's worth living like this. Everyone living inside a monster's corpse while the
                    outside world is still healing. And the only source of "food" are the doses, harvested from the
                    crystalized blood inside the monster's veins. Where ever you go, you'll have to choose before time
                    runs out.</p>

                    group. My main goal of this project was to learn the Godot game engine.
